# Change logs for Rudder 4.0.\* versions

Rudder 4.0 has reached End of Life the 30th June 2017.

This page provides a summary of changes for each version. Previous beta
and rc versions are listed below for convenience.

**Main new features in Rudder 4.0:**

  - Policy can be applied in "Audit mode", which only checks
    configuration and does not enforce it, on a global, per-node or
    per-directive basis
  - Global redesign of web interface
  - Files from shared folder can be selected using a file browser
  - Agents can be remotely started using API (wrapper for "rudder remote
    run" on the CLI)
  - Settings API
  - Rudder agent status command
  - Performance improved (compliance, policy generation are faster)
  - New file copy protocol

A blog post explaining these features is
available here: https://www.normation.com/en/blog/2016/11/11/rudder-4-0/
