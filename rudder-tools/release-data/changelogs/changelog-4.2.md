### Release Note

This software is in beta status and has several known bugs
(particularly [\#11027](https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/11027), [\#10961](https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/10961), [\#10990](https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/10990) and [\#11051](https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/11051)).
You should hence not use it in production.
However, we do encourage testing, and welcome all and any
feedback\!

To be able to finish the installation (on ubuntu), after `apt-get install rudder-server-root` fails, you will need to:

- workaround #10990

```
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/
git init
git add .
git commit -q -m "initial commit"
```

- workaround #11051

```
touch /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-share-acl-24.conf /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-share-acl.conf
cp /opt/rudder/etc/ssl/rudder.crt /opt/rudder/etc/ssl/ca.cert
```

- finish installation:

```
apt-get install -f
```

- reset git repos (because it is in a bad state)

```
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -q -m "initial commit"
```
